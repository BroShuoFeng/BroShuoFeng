- 👋 Hi, I’m @BroShuoFeng
- 👀 I’m interested in development of constitutive models and its numerical implementation of geomaterials, espacially for granular soils subjected to cyclic loads.
- 🌱 I’m currently focusing on modelling the particle breakage behaviour of granular soils.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on boundary value problem solver, including FEM and DEM.
- 📫 If you are intersted in what I am doing, feel free to contact me
